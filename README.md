## World_Weather_Analysis


## Overview of the Project


After assisting in the development of the PlanMyTrip app., I received recommendations and input from beta testers.  Using their suggestions and input statements, I filtered the data for their weather preferences, and used it to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chose four cities and I created a travel itinerary.



## Results


After generating random coordinates (latitude and longitude), I retrieved city names and retrieved weather data for each location.  Using Beta user input statements, I defined range of comfortable temperatures. I filtered cities within the range and found hotels in each city. I then created the heat map with tags for selected hotel and city.

Based on the four cities chosen by the Beta users, I created a travel route.
